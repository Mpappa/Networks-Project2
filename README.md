To run this code, you can save it in a file called "server.py" and run it using a Python interpreter. Here are the steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the "server.py" file is located using the cd command.
Type python server.py to run the file.
The server will start running and listening for connections on port 9000.
Once the server is running, you can connect to it using a client program. You can run multiple instances of the client program to simulate multiple users. Remember to use different usernames for each client.


To run the client program, you can save it in a file called "client.py" and run it using a Python interpreter. Here are the steps:

Open a new terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the "client.py" file is located using the cd command.
Type python client.py to run the file.
The program will prompt you to enter a username.
Once you enter the username and server IP address, the client program will connect to the server and display the list of users currently in the group and the last two messages posted on the board.
You can then post a new message or retrieve the content of an existing message by providing its message ID.
To leave the group, type "exit" and the program will disconnect from the server and close.
You can run multiple instances of the client program to simulate multiple users. Remember to use different usernames for each client.
